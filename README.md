# PERMA CLIMATE CHANGE

**PermaClimateChange** is a bot you can use to store rss feeds on Arweave's network blockchain about a given subject. In this use case it is science and environment focused on climate change.

The earth is in a race against climate change.
Everyday data shows the climate change is getting worse with air pollution, rising sea levels, extreme heat, droughts, and much more.
This is affecting people everywhere. 
We have the tools and we must not forget what's happening now.
So let's store rss feeds on this issue in the permaweb. 

News feeds allow you to see when websites have added new content.
Feeds are generally known as RSS ('Really Simple Syndication')
For this bot I have used an interesting rss feed topic which includes Climate change.
* RSS Feed For: BBC News - Science & Environment
